## MERN Stack Learning Goals

- [x] Understand what MongoDB is and its benefits
- Mongoose is an object data modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It provides an API to model the data in our database.
- MongoDB stores data using a document data structure. Documents are JSON-like objects with key-value pairs. Documents with similar data are stored within collections.
- Embedded data models make it possible to update related data in a single operation.Use an embedded data model when you are trying to model the following:
  One-to-One relationships
  Small One-to-Many relationships

- Referencing, when ObjectIds hold a reference to a document in a separate collection the benefits of embedding are lost when we use referencing. Here are a few situations where we might need to use referencing:
  Many-to-Many relationships
  Modeling large hierarchical data sets
  Large One-to-Many relationships

- [x] Identify the differences between SQL and NoSQL databases
- SQL databases store data in tables where each row may represent an object.
- NoSQL databases can store data in several different ways other than tables. These include:
  Documents, Graphs, Key-value pairs, Wide-column stores

-[x] Express is a web application framework for Node. It provides us with tools for the following things:

- Write handlers to respond to different HTTP verb requests at different URL paths.
  Backend into an API that your frontend will use to retrieve information. Combine with view rendering engines to generate responses by passing data to templates.
- Frontend will be handled primarily by React and Redux
- Add middleware at any point within the request handling pipeline.

-[x] Axios is a promise based HTTP client (Axios) library to make XMLHttpRequests from the browser or HTTP requests from your Node environment.

-[x] Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment. It allows us to utilize JavaScript code outside of the browser in order to build network applications

- [x] SQL or structured query language is associated with relational databases and is used to process a structured database, while NoSQL databases are not relational. NoSQL databases are mostly document-oriented, non-structured and distributed, unlike SQL databases. Non-relational databases are more distributed and scattered in comparison to structured databases.
